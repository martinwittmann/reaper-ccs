# To make writing pages easier, they can define their own actions too.
#actions:
  # "page.set_state" is always available as an action and lets you set custom
  # state variables.
  # In each control's action you can optionally define conditions that have to
  # be met for the current action(s) to be triggered.
  # Examples:
  # "[page.set_state:my_name:$MY_VARIABLE]y"
  # "[page.set_state:leds_show:mute]"

  # controls:
  #   button1:
  #     actions:
  #     - "[page.action_always_executed]"
  #     - conditions:
  #         - $_STATE.leds_show.is: mute
  #       actions:
  #       - "[controller.toggle_mute_track1]"
